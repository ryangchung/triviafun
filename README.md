# Triviafun

This is a trivia mobile application for Android. This app uses API requests from the Open Trivia API. It turns the requested information (questions, answers, difficulty level) into a playable game with many different categories and an increasing difficulty.

## Technology Choices

To target Android mobile users, I chose Android Studios as the platform as it is the native and recommended way to create apps for Android. As Kotlin is the officially supported language by Android, I used it.

However, if the focus was cross-platform compatibility the better choice would be React Native.

## Challenges that were overcome

- Proper asynchronous API calls that don't block threads
- Image scaling for all screen sizes
